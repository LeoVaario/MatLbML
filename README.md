This is work from a intensive study Machine Learning course. 
A neural network was used to classify 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit (0-9)

A sample of 60,000 images were used from the MNIST dataset, 10,000 for training and 50,000 for testing.
example 5_1_4.m contains the most comprehensive model for best result.
